# NPluginsManager
This is a simple generic plugins manager written in C# and targeted on .NET Standard, all in a single library file without 3rd party dependencies, allows everyone to use this as a base for creating their own plugin system.
It already provided the plugin interface with the loader which can be easy to manage the plugins.

Currently this is in early alpha stage and might be have many bugs, documentation and tests are not (yet) completed, but for basic usage can have a look on [TestPlugin](TestPlugin/) and [TestPluginHost](TestPluginHost/) project.
